In the heart of Northern Ghana, beyond the bustling towns, lies the Daji — the royal forest, where nature teaches patience, rhythm, and resilience.
Long before fast fashion, Northern weavers worked with the same patience that the trees take to grow, threading history into every strand of fugu.
Daji is born from this legacy: each handwoven smock carries the rhythm of the loom, the story of a village, and the dignity of a forest that preserves life across generations.
Wearing Daji is more than fashion — it is stepping into a living story, connecting heritage, leadership, and identity.
